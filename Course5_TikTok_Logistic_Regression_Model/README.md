# TikTok Logistic Regression Model

## Purpose
This project demonstrates the use of exploratory data analysis (EDA) and logistic regression to predict and analyze outcomes within the TikTok dataset.

## Key Steps
1. **EDA & Checking Model Assumptions**:
   - Explore the data and ensure it meets the assumptions required for logistic regression.
2. **Model Building and Evaluation**:
   - Build and evaluate a logistic regression model to predict outcomes.
3. **Interpreting Results**:
   - Extract key insights and provide business recommendations based on the model.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Deliverables
- EDA results and logistic regression model evaluation.
- Insights and recommendations for business strategy.
