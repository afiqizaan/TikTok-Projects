# TikTok-Projects
This repository showcases data analysis and machine learning projects focused on TikTok's data. It includes exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, logistic regression, and a predictive model to classify videos as claims or opinions, aiming to reduce misinformation and provide actionable insights for platform improvement.

## Repository Overview
This repository contains a series of data analysis and machine learning projects completed as part of a TikTok-focused course series. The projects utilize TikTok's dataset to perform exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, logistic regression, and predictive modeling. The goal is to extract actionable insights and develop solutions to reduce misinformation on the platform.

## Project Highlights

### 1. [Course 2: TikTok Data Understanding](./Course2_TikTok_Data_Understanding)
- **Objective**: Investigate and organize TikTok's dataset for initial insights and preparation for further analysis.
- **Key Focus**: Dataframe creation, summary statistics, and variable exploration.

### 2. [Course 3: TikTok Exploratory Data Analysis](./Course3_TikTok_Exploratory_Data_Analysis)
- **Objective**: Perform in-depth EDA on the dataset, focusing on variables that distinguish claim videos from opinion videos.
- **Key Focus**: Data cleaning, visualization, and variable relationship exploration.

### 3. [Course 4: TikTok Hypothesis Testing and Insights](./Course4_TikTok_Hypothesis_Testing_and_Insights)
- **Objective**: Conduct hypothesis testing using descriptive and inferential statistics to provide actionable business recommendations.
- **Key Focus**: Hypothesis formulation, statistical testing, and business insights.

### 3. [Course 5: TikTok Logistic Regression Model](./Course5_TikTok_Logistic_Regression_Model)
- **Objective**: Build and evaluate a logistic regression model to analyze outcomes within TikTok's dataset.
- **Key Focus**: EDA, logistic regression modeling, and interpreting results.

### 4. [Course 6: TikTok Claim vs. Opinion Model](./Course6_TikTok_Claim_vs_Opinion_Model)
- **Objective**: Develop a machine learning model to classify TikTok videos as claims or opinions, aiming to reduce misinformation.
- **Key Focus**: Ethical considerations, feature engineering, and predictive modeling.

## Dataset
The TikTok dataset used in this repository contains key metadata and features related to TikTok videos. It includes attributes such as:

- **Video metadata**: Captions, hashtags, and content descriptions.
- **Classification labels**: Indicators for whether the video presents a "claim" or an "opinion."
- **User engagement metrics**: Likes, shares, comments, and views.
- **Video features**: Duration, categories, and trends.
