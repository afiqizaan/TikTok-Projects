# TikTok Claim vs. Opinion Model

## Purpose
This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether a TikTok video presents a "claim" or an "opinion," aiming to reduce misinformation on the platform.

## Key Steps
1. **Ethical Considerations**:
   - Assess the ethical implications of using a predictive model for misinformation mitigation.
2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Perform feature selection, extraction, and transformation to prepare data for modeling.
3. **Modeling**:
   - Build and evaluate predictive models to classify TikTok videos as claims or opinions.
   - Provide actionable insights and next steps for model deployment.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- XGBoost

## Deliverables
- A machine learning model to classify TikTok videos.
- Insights and recommendations for addressing misinformation.
